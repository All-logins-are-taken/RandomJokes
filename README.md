***Test task on Vue.js***<br>
Develop from scratch an SPA that makes a request to https://api.chucknorris.io/. <br>
In the interface must output 3 random jokes (/random API endpoint), and there should be a joke search form (API endpoint/search).<br>
***user interface***<br>
The user interface should have a finished, modern, pleasant appearance.<br> 
It must be responsive and works in all major modern browsers at least listed here: https://caniuse.com/es6.<br>
The design can be borrowed from the site using the API itself, if there are no other ideas.<br>
***Details***<br>
A set of random jokes is applied when the page is opened and does not require any clicks in the user interface.<br>
The search form should submit the user's request and display the results without page reload.<br> 
The form must not have a Submit button or an API request should be sent upon user input.<br> 
But not immediately, after some time delay so as not to reload the API with unnecessary requests.<br> 
Make a page-by-page output<br>
Searching results is not required, but it will be a plus.<br>
***The only restrictions on technologies that can be used:***<br> 
- project must be implemented in Vue.js and without the use of PHP and other server-side languages.<br>
- The rest are vicorists of the technologies you want. <br>

Source codes should be preserved configs for package managers, as is usually done in projects, so that there are easy to apply on a new server. <br>
The use of containerization is not required, but it is will be a plus.
